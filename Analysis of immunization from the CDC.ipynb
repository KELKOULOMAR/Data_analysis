    "Some notes on interpreting the answer. If the `had_chickenpox_column` is either `1` (for yes) or `2` for no, and that the `num_chickenpox_vaccine_column` is the number of doses a child has been given of the varicella vaccine, then a positive correlation (e.g. `corr > 0`) would mean that an increase in `had_chickenpox_column` (which means more no) would mean an increase in the `num_chickenpox_vaccine_column` (which means more doses of vaccine). If `corr < 0` then there is a negative correlation, indicating that having had chickenpox is related to an increase in the number of vaccine doses. Also, `pval` refers to the probability the relationship observed is significant. In this case `pval` is very very small (will end in `e-18` indicating a very small number), which means the result unlikely to be by chance.\n",
